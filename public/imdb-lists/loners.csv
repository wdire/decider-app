Jeremiah Johnson lyrics by John Rubenstein and Tim McIntire:

""Jeremiah Johnson made his way into the mountains, bettin' on forgettin' all the troubles that he knew.
The trail was wide and narrow, the eagle or the sparrow
showed the path he was to follow, as it flew.
A mountain man is a lonely man and he leaves a lot behind.
It ought to have been different, but you often times will find,  that the story doesn't always go the way you had in mind.
Jeremiah's story was that kind
